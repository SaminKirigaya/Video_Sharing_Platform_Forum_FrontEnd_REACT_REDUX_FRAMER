## Cautions And Optimization
- For your server usage you need to change axios defaults base url and video uploading url of backend that I was sending with xhr for uploader animations.

- Go to index.js
- axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8000' // backend restapi base location 
- Change this localhost to your hosting
- At YourVideos.jsx Go there
- Change const backendlink = 'http://localhost:8000' // change it according to ur server

- Remember I used localhost cause it was my development server
